This is my first portfolio which describes my experience in the Software field and a little about me, made using HTML and CSS.

The Home screen is in the index.html file.

The About screen is in the about.html file.

style.css is the CSS file.

Images which have been taken from ShutterStack (which is an open source website for high quality pictures),  are included in the "images" folder.
Logos have been included in the "images" -> "logo" folder (which are transparent png pictures downloaded from the free internet).
